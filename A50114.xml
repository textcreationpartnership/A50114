            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

I say then, let them not only <hi>Hold</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi> but Gladly <hi>Hold together</hi> in them; and never Vex one another about the <hi>Media</hi> which they Raise them on. Particularly, In many matters of <hi>Church Order,</hi> there are two Considerations which may be a <hi>Balm</hi> to heal many Contentions. One is, That the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all <hi>Church-Societies,</hi> is laid in the Light and Law of <hi>Nature</hi> it self, A Church is a <hi>Society</hi> of Humane Race;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49226:39"/> and hath its Particularities wherein i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cieties. There needs no <hi>New Express Command</hi> for what the Law and Light of Nature do's require in all Societies Combining for the Worship of God. Another is this▪ That the <hi>First Commandment</hi> ha's cut out much Business for <hi>Church-Societies,</hi> which 'tis possible the <hi>Second Commandment</hi> may not so plainly reach unto; yea, such a <hi>Society</hi> ha's many things to do, which not the <hi>First,</hi> but the <hi>Second</hi> of the Tables in the Divine Law, ha's Enjoyned the doing of. I say then; if Saints that see not all with the same Eyes, can do the <hi>same things,</hi> though not on the <hi>same grounds,</hi> there is no Thing to be a Ground for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling. Pardon me, if I touch upon two or three Instances, which are, I think, the <hi>Only</hi> ones, wherein our Churches have their (not <hi>Contentions,</hi> blessed be God, but) <hi>Varieties.</hi> I will mention them, though I should meet with the <hi>Parters Portion</hi> for it; or find <hi>Livies</hi> observation true, <hi>Media via ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Amicos parit, nec Inimicos tollit.</hi>

                     <p>Our <hi>Churches</hi> do Ordinarily Expect from those whom they Admit unto Constant and Compleat Communion with them, some few savoury Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions [<hi>Written,</hi> if not, <hi>Oral</hi>] of what Regenerating <hi>Influences</hi> the Ordinances, or the Providences of God, have had upon their Souls.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49226:40"/> whoever do's Address a Church of the Lord Jesus for their <hi>Fellowship,</hi> should Endeavour to do it with such Language and Matter as may be like that of, <hi>One Returning to God.</hi> If there be any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Contest, whether the <hi>Brethren,</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> are to have any Acquaintance with, or Interest in, the management of this matter, I am Confident, That as the <hi>Pastors</hi> who are the <hi>Porters</hi> to the House of our God, will generally Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what <hi>Experiences</hi> their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants have attain'd unto, so the <hi>Pastors</hi> will as generally grant, it is not <hi>Ʋnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for them to Communicate unto the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church, the <hi>Tast▪</hi> which they have had of the <hi>Graces</hi> in such as they now propound unto them, to be Receiv'd as <hi>Brethren:</hi> Yea, That it is many wayes Comfortable and Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if not altogether <hi>Necessary.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then, a <hi>Temper,</hi> wherein we <hi>may,</hi> as hitherto we <hi>do,</hi> in this thing <hi>Ʋnite!</hi> I have been Concern'd with some God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, who have at first shown much and hot <hi>Antipathy</hi> against <hi>This Way</hi> of our Church, and yet
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49226:40"/> ask'd Admittance to the Table of the Lord. These have Consented unto me, That I should put what <hi>Questions</hi> I pleas'd in my <hi>Trials</hi> of them; That I should herewithal take in Writing what <hi>Minutes I</hi> pleas'd of their <hi>Answers</hi> to me; That being my self now <hi>Satisfy'd</hi> Concerning them, I might if I pleas'd Offer that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> unto any or all of the Church who look'd for it, at our usual Opportunity. These Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions immediately opened <hi>Their</hi> way, in <hi>Ours,</hi> unto the Table of the Lord, without any D fficulty unto either of us. But let it all this while be Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; That I am not proving what <hi>must</hi> be done; I am only showing what <hi>may</hi> be done, to prevent Fires, when they may be like to follow other-wise.</p>
                     <p>Again, Our <hi>Churches</hi> are some of them furnished, with <hi>Elders,</hi> whose whole <hi>Office</hi> tis [God help 'em to Do it <hi>Well</hi>] To <hi>Watch over the Conversation of the Church-Members with Authority.</hi> It is pleaded, That nothing is Plainer in Scripture, Than <hi>Elders, who Rule well, and are Worthy of Double Honour,</hi> though

And what shall now be done in this case? I would modestly offer thus much.

I suppose, None will be so Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd as to Deny <hi>This</hi> at least; That
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49226:41"/> all the <hi>Church-Officers</hi> are to take the Advice of their <hi>Pastor</hi> with them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, I subjoyn, That a man may be a <hi>Distinct Officer</hi> from his <hi>Pastor,</hi> and yet not have a <hi>Distinct Office</hi> from him; the <hi>Pastor</hi> may be the <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> and yet he may have <hi>Elders</hi> to assist him in <hi>Ruling</hi> and in the actual Discharge of some Things, which <hi>They</hi> are Able and Proper to be serviceable unto him in. This Consideration being laid in, I will perswade my self, every <hi>Pastor</hi> among us, <hi>will</hi> allow me, <hi>That</hi> there is much Work to be done for God, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what belongs to the <hi>Admission</hi> and <hi>Exclusion</hi> of Church-Members; in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inspecting the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Walk,</hi> of them all, and the first <hi>Appearance of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> with them; in preventing the very Beginnings of <hi>Ill-Blood</hi> among them; and Instructing of all from <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49226:42"/> They <hi>must</hi> allow me, That <hi>This Work</hi> is too heavy for any <hi>one man;</hi> and that more than <hi>one man,</hi> yea, no less than <hi>all our Churches</hi> do suffer beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, because no more of <hi>This Work</hi> is thorougly performed. Moreover, they will acknowledge to me, That it is an usual Thing with a Prudent and a Faithful <hi>Pastor,</hi> Himself to single out some of the more grave, solid, aged Brethren in his Congregation, to <hi>Assist</hi> him in many parts of <hi>this work,</hi> on many occasions in a year; nor will such a <hi>Pastor</hi> ordinarily do any important thing in his <hi>Government,</hi> without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first heard the Counsel of such Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. In short, There are few dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <hi>Pastors,</hi> but what make many occasional <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> every year. I say then, suppose, the Church by a Vote Recommend some such Brethren (the fittest they <hi>have,</hi> and alwayes more than <hi>one</hi>) unto the more <hi>Stated Assistence</hi> of their <hi>Pastors,</hi> in the <hi>Church Rule</hi> wherein they may be <hi>Helps</hi> unto him? [I do not propose, that they should be <hi>Biennial</hi> or <hi>Triennial</hi> onely;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49226:42"/> though I know very famous Churches throughout <hi>Europe</hi> have them so!] Yea, and what if they should by Solemn <hi>Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> be Commended unto the Benediction of God, in what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they have to do? What Objection can be made against the <hi>Lawfulness?</hi> I think, None can be made against the <hi>Ʋsefulness</hi> of such a thing? Truly, for my part, if the <hi>Fifth Chapter</hi> of the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> would not bear me out, when Conscience both of my Duty and my Weakness made me to desire such <hi>Assistences,</hi> I would see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>First Chapter</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> would not. Only, let it all this while also be Remembred, That a total want of <hi>Men,</hi> is the sad case of some Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which cannot be thus provided for.</p>
                     <p>Once more, There has been a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, <hi>What</hi> is the <hi>Watch</hi> which our Churches owe to the <hi>Adult Children,</hi> that were in their Infancy Baptised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us?

How shall these two parties now come together? Perhaps hardly enough; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, Let it be Considered, Whether some cannot come to do that as a point of pure <hi>Morality,</hi> which others choose to do as a point of <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> If one that feeds and sleeps in my Family do commit any gross Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I would <hi>Admonish</hi> him for it, in the hearing of those that have heard of his Offence; and if he don't <hi>Reform,</hi> I would openly fix upon him the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of, <hi>One that walks Disorderly.</hi> This would I do, as a a piece of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Charity,</hi> although there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49226:43"/> a Text in <hi>Matthew,</hi> or although there were nothing after the Fourth of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to warrant this proceeding. Why then may not Churches count the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>Reproving,</hi> to be War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough, in thus dealing with such as have been Baptised in their Bosomes, although the <hi>Statute-Law</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> should be silent in it? Another thing that may be Considered is, Whether both sides might not agree in Reviving the Ancient Ordinance of CONFIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION; I mean, For the Elders of the Churches to send for, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as they come to Mens and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Estate, and Examine them strictly about their <hi>Conversion</hi> to God, and their Inclinations to Renew and Observe their <hi>Baptismal Covenant.</hi> Upon this Examination, They that are found <hi>Fit</hi> for it, may be Regularly <hi>Confirmed</hi> in <hi>Church-priviledges.</hi> They that are not so, may with suitable Instructions and Awakenings, be <hi>Detained,</hi> for a while from some <hi>sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49226:44"/> of many Differences.</p>
                     <p>I am not unsensible of the further <hi>Noises</hi> that have been in the Rearing of our <hi>Temple,</hi> about the Subjects which <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> is to be Extended unto. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that <hi>Restrain</hi> it unto the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> do vary from the most of their Neighbours; but, even those which <hi>Enlarge</hi> it unto the Children of some that are not in <hi>Full Communion,</hi> do it not exactly in the same Notion; some do Baptise them, as being only in a <hi>Catholick</hi> Church-state, and others as being also in a <hi>Particular.</hi> And yet they mostly, Accord in this, That the <hi>Administrator</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is generally to be an Officer some way concerned with a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> and the Baptised should be under the <hi>Laws</hi> of our Lord Jesus as they are Administred in such a Church.

It is to be Remarked how often the Evangelist <hi>Luke,</hi> records the, ONE ACCORD, which the Primitive Believers were famous for; that, ONE ACCORD, seems to be Celebrated as one of the most <hi>Memorable</hi> things that could be mentioned. We have heard, That our <hi>Brethren</hi> beyond the Seas, are hopefully curing the <hi>Gangraenes</hi> of which heretofore they have Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and coming to ONE ACCORD, in those Things which formerly have been, <hi>Apples of Strife,</hi> among them. We have heard, That the <hi>Body</hi> of our Brethren is no more like the Monster once born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as we read) which was born with <hi>two Heads,</hi> that were still arguing, opposing, and in Eager Disputes assaulting one another.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49226:53"/> The Tidings have been, <hi>As Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to our Thirsty Souls;</hi> and I bespeak your Praises on that behalf, to the God, who <hi>Maketh Peace in His High Places.</hi> It is not for <hi>me</hi> to Prognosticate upon this Transaction; though I know that when <hi>Abraham</hi> had propos'd overtures of <hi>Peace</hi> unto his Kinsman, God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately show'd him the <hi>Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> and said, <hi>All this Land, unto thee will I give it!</hi> But I'l quote you a few words of the Reverend MEADS, in the Sermon Preached upon Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.
